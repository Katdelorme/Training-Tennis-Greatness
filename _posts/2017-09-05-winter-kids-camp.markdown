Young tennis athletes come improve your game while having fun.

Led by Tennis Director, Liburd along with our top quality staff of tennis professionals. The camp will include instruction, drills, supervision and feedback. With regular match play to help campers put it all together.

So come out and join us for some hard work and a lot of fun. Camp lunches and a refreshment break will be provided daily. With poolside water park time afterwards. We look forward to seeing you. 

Remember racket and tennis clothing are mandated.
